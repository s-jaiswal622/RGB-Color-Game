# RGB-Color-Game
Developed using: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript. 
Eg of RGB colors: rgb(120, 20, 30) value:0-255.
 
The game’s objective is to guess the correct RGB color from a given set of colors. 
It generates a random set of colors and the user is require to click the color which he/she guesses
and uses javascripts for verification if the user guesses the correct color. 
The layout of the game contains the title ie “The great RGB color Game” and there will be two modes named as “easy” and “hard” 
which will decide the number of squares that user has to play with. In easy mode we have 3 choices of different color which are
generated randomly and in the hard mode we have 6 choices of different colors. 
The user can also change the color generated by using “new game “ button. 
Whenever the user click on the color of their choice then if their selected square is incorrect then the square will be disappear from the screen.
This effect is achieved by setting the color of the selected square to the background color so that it merges with the background
and the “try again” message will display on the screen. Otherwise if the selected color square is correct then all the disappeared
square will appear on the screen with the same right color and the user has win the game.
